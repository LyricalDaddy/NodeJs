1. Again added all what was needed 
	- npm install a bunch of stuff (express, ejs, body-parser) [see in package.json]
2. Set up two ejs' with a form on one that does a POST request which redirects back to the site but since it did a POST something changed data was added to the friends array.

- use body-parser
